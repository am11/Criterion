A dead-simple, yet extensible, C unit testing framework.

![Screencast](./doc/screencast.gif)

## Philosophy

Most test frameworks for C require a lot of boilerplate code to
set up tests and test suites -- you need to create a main,
then register new test suites, then register the tests within
these suits, and finally call the right functions.

This gives the user great control, at the unfortunate cost of simplicity.

Criterion follows the KISS principle, while keeping the control
the user would have with other frameworks:

* [x] Tests are automatically registered when declared.
* [x] Implements a xUnit framework structure.
* [x] A default entry point is provided, no need to declare a main
  unless you want to do special handling.
* [x] Test are isolated in their own process, crashes and signals can be
  reported and tested.
* [x] There is a support for theories alongside tests
* [x] Progress and statistics can be followed in real time with report hooks.
* [x] TAP output format can be enabled with an option.
* [x] Runs on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows (Compiling with MinGW GCC).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed, but must follow a simple set of rules in order to
be merged.

**Please follow these conventions if you want your pull request(s) accepted.**

### General

* Use 4 (four) spaces for indentation.
* No trailing whitespaces.
* 80 chars column limit.
* No trash files. Trash files are by-products of the compilation process, or
  generated files that does not need to be under version control.
* Pull requests must compile and work properly.
* Pull requests must be mergeable automatically.
* Number of commits in a pull request should be kept to one commit and all
  additional commits must be squashed.
* You may have more than one commit in a pull request if the commits are
  separate changes, otherwise squash them.

### Translations

* You can contribute new translation files for output messages, on the
  condition that you are fluent with the language itself.
* Each correction on existing translations must be followed by a
  rationale ("why would the translation be better if the change is applied?")

## F.A.Q.

**Q. What's wrong with other test frameworks?**  
A. I worked with CUnit and Check, and I must say that they do their job
   very well -- the only thing that bugs me is that setting up a test
   suite from scratch is a pain, it should really be simpler. Most
   (if not all) high-level languages have test frameworks with automatic
   test registration, but all the ones for C require you to set up a
   main, manually register suites, then tests. Criterion tries to
   fix these shortcomings.

**Q. Where has this been tested?**  
A. Currently, on Linux 2.6.32 and Linux 3.15.7, although it should work on
   most \*nix systems; Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10, FreeBSD 10.0, Windows 7 and 2K.
